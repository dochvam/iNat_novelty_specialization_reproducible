# iNat_novelty_favoritism_reproducible
Reproduces the investigation into iNaturalist users' novelty bias and favoritism 
bias.

To run the code, create a subdirectory called "input_data" and add raw data
files as obtained from the 
[iNaturalist online export tool](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export).
Then, execute the files in the directory `code_main/` in order from 1 to 5.

The validation simulations in `code_simulation/` depend on the real dataset to
produce realistic abundance patterns across species.
